                                             Question 2 Explanation

Command to Compile (not link) :
        gcc -S add.c -o add.s -lm  


-S : To stop execution at compiling phase
-lm : to link <Math.h> with add.c because the math functions in math.h have implementations 
      in libm.so (or libm.a for static linking), and libm is not linked in by default.
      So to use math functions it is necessary. 


Erros - None 

Warnings - 
    1) return type defaults to ‘int’ : Return type of function add has not been declared,
                                       so default return type of add function is 'int'.
        
    2) implicit declaration of function ‘round’ : function round has not been defined, still we are calling it.
    3) incompatible implicit declaration of built-in function ‘round’: function 'round' is already present int <Math.h>.
                                                                       So either include <Math.h> or 
                                                                       provide a declaration of function 'round'.
