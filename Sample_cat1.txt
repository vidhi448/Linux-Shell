                                              Question 1 Explanation

files - checkifgreater.asm , Greater.c

NOTE : CHANGE THE FUNCTION NAME OF _start AS IT IS HAS MULTIPLE DEFINITIONS IN ASSEMBLY LIBRARIES. OTHERWISE 
       ERROR WILL ARISE DUE TO MULTIPLE DEFINITIONS.

Explanation for checkifgreater.asm (ASM FILE) -
       global _start: I declared _start as global, so that the kernel knows that execution begins from _start function.
       macro write : this macro takes message and message lenght as input and prints it using system call
       function _start : calls function checkifgreater
       function checkGreater :  takes 2 integers as input and finds the greater number, if x>y then prints "1", else "0"            

Explanation for Greater.c (C FILE)-
       This function simply calls the function checkGreater from the assembly file.

Linking both the files -
       ERROR:
       Both the files get compiled(not link) separately  but there is an ERROR IN LINKING.
       gcc checkifgreater.o Greater.o -o a.out
       Greater.o: In function `main':
       Greater.c:(.text+0x6e): undefined reference to `checkGreater'
       collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
       Makefile:10: recipe for target 'linking' failed
       make: *** [linking] Error 1


BOTH THE FILES DO NOT WORK TOGETHER (ERROR IN LINKING) BECAUSE -
       A program can have only one entry point. In this assembly program the only entry point is _start as
       _start was declared as global. Declaring _start as global tells the kernel where the program execution begins.
       When we call checkGreater function from main() function of C program, the assembly program does not give it the 
       access as its execution should begin with _start not checkGreater. 
       In order to solve this either call _start in the main() function of C program or make checkGreater function global.
